/*
Gao Rexford:
	Exporting to a provider: AS cannot export routes learned from other providers or peers
	Exporting to a peer: Can export routes from customers. Does NOT export routes from peers or providers.

Note:
	A seeded announcement does not get replaced during propagation.

Key changes:
	You don't *send* announcements to a queue.
		- A customer sending to a provider is *really* a provider going through its customers and seeing if they have anything of interest
		- Prevents excessive copying, which was a dynamic vector in the previous version of the extrapolator
		- Only copy an announcement from another AS into this AS when that announcement is better than the current accepted one

	Propagation of a relationship each is a specific method:
		- Prevents excessive branching in the core loop

	MH/tiebraking/randomization mode is a global feature known at the extrapolator-scope. 
		Do not decide this at the AS level, which must figure out the MH mode at the most iterated point in the code every single time

	Precompute the randomization hashes

	Overall minimize branching. We want this thing to be a straight forward process as much as possible

/**
 * The priority is how two announcements are compared. An announcement with a larger pariority should be chosen over a lesser priority
 * 
 * The union is used such that we may edit the individual components of the priority (without bit shifting)
 *	And also perform the simple integer comparison of two priorities
 * 
 * The order matters here. For example, a seeded announcement is better than any non-seeded announcement. Thus it takes up the highest bits. 
 * That way in an integer comparison the seeded bits make the seeded priority larger than any other priority.
 * 
 * The logic continues, where seeded is more important than the relationship. Relationship is more important than the path length.
 * 
 * The path length property is non-intuitive. Here, a smaller path length is preffered. 
 * However, to keep the simple integer comparison, the smaller path length must result in a larger integer in the field in the priority. 
 * Thus, we subtract from the maximum integer as we propagate rather than increase from 0. That way, a smaller path results in a larger priority.
 * 
 * The reservedField does nothing as of writing
