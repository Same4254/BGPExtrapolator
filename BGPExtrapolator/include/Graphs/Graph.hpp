/**
 * The Graph is a structure capable of building a topological graph from CAIDA relationships, and seeding ground-truth MRT announcements,
 *	and allowing that information to propagate while strictly obeying Gao-Rexford propagation rules.
 * 
 * Gao Rexford Paper: "Stable Internet Routing Without Global Coordination" by Lixin Gao and Jennifer Rexford.
 *
 * Results that are relevant during propagation: 
 *  AS Export to Provider:
 *   - Provider routes: no
 *   - Peer routes: no
 *   - Customer routes: yes
 *
 *  Export to Customer:
 *   - Provider routes: yes
 *   - Peer routes: yes
 *   - Customer routes: no
 *
 *  Export to Peer:
 *   - Provider routes: no
 *   - Peer routes: no
 *   - Customer routes: yes
 * 
 * Design and Performance Goals:
 *  - Allow different propgation policies to be distributed among the graph
 *  - Allow different seeding policies for a graph
 *  - Once propagation starts, there is no heap allocations or de-allocations (Minimize performance hits due to uneccesary heap activity)
 *  - Allow local ribs to be structured in memory in any way, easily. Such that different allocation methods can be easily compared and changed
 *  - Separate neccessary announcement data for propagation (cached data) and unecessary, or uncommonly used, data (static data) 
 *    - Allows more cached data to fit into the cache (increases performance)
